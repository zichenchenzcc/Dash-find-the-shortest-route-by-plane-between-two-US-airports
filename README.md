# Dash-find the shortest route by plane between two US airports.
This dash app allows user to find out the shortest path (by plane) between start airport and destination airport, including a title, a real-time updated map, four dropdown manus for user to choose start city (and then available airport) and destination city (and then available airport), and the results for total distance, passing cities, and airline combinations.
The real-time updated map will mark start airport as an airport, intermediate cities as markers, and destination airport as a flag. Also, there will be a connection between every two passing cities.
Use controls.py to generate data, and then use app.py to access to dash.
